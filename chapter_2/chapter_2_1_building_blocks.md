# Chapter 2.1 The Building Blocks of AWS: AZs and Regions

Global Infrastructure
Regions and availability zones

Region: locations
Availability zones: think of an AZ as a datacenter
Data center: building with servers

Availability zones
Could consist of several data centers, but they care close together
Physically separated by a meaningful distance but all within 60 miles of each other

Region
- Geographical area
- Consists of 2+ availability zones

Edge Locations
- endpoints for AWS that are used for caching content
- there are many more edge locations than regions
- A networking point of presence that is one of many spread across the globe that is commonly used to cache content.

Exam Tips
- region is a physical location with +2 AZs
- an AZ is one or more discrete data centers - housed in separate facilities
- edge locations are endpoints for AWS to use for caching content
